Prompt X-ray emission from neutron star mergers, calculated for structured relativistic outflows at any viewing angle.

## Overview

PromptX simulates the emission from gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets and magnetar-powered winds using phenomenological models. It supports Gaussian, power-law, and top-hat outflows, calculating spectra and light curves observed from arbitrary angles.

## Features

- Structured jet and wind emission modeling
- Doppler-boosted observer-frame calculations
- Light curve and spectrum generation across X-ray and gamma-ray bands

## System Compatibility

The code has currently only been tested on macOS. It may work on other operating systems, but has not been extensively tested or officially supported. All documentation assumes a Unix-based system (e.g., macOS or Linux).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjules0609/promptx.git
cd promptx
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Usage

To run default examples:

   ```bash
   cd scripts/
   python examples.py
   ```

Outputs are saved to ./scripts/out directory.

## Documentation
